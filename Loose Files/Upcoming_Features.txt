- Villager Head(s) have a set of trade-ins for Emerald(s). These trades will have less value than a trade with an actual villager, but still valuable.
    Maybe a Katan style trade-in system.
-X- Donkey/Mule/Llama/Trader Llama can pick up containers. Contents are serialized and written to a container ItemStack.
    Every container gives a level of Slowness (Half if Llama). If the head is removed while carrying Wither I will be imposed. If
    killed or dropped, all items will spill onto the ground (like bundles).
- Head-by-head toggle for effects in Config
-X- Replace Nether Mob's Infinite Fire Resistance I with an on-damage system, granting Fire Resistance I for a short time.
    (Magma Cube, Blaze, Wither Skeleton, Zombie Piglin, Ghast, Strider, Zoglin)
-X- Replace Slime/Magma Cube's no fall damage with a drastic reduction in fall damage instead (80%?).
