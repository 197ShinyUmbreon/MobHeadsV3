    "-" Not Fixed.
    "-X-" Fixed.

-Decollation Smithing recipe is broken and now requires Dirt as a template temporarily.
-X- Damage type "Hot Floor" was not taken into account for fire-resistant creatures. (Magma Block)
-X- Chested Heads would disallow gliding regardless of containers held
- Slime/Magma Cube heads will occasionally store a jump that will unleash on teleport/camera move/reapplication of head after death.
-X- Head or Decollation Pearl is voided when inventory is full
-X- Guardians do not restore Air on Frog Head
-X- Breaking an Armor Stand will attempt to drop a head
-X- Right-Clicking with an empty hand on someone wearing a Mooshroom Head does not give food
-X- Head worn Tab list does not update on death.
-X- New Player skins are not updated with a new head (if PlayerProfile != old.PlayerProfile, replace?)
-X- Warden Head allows you to run with Darkness now??? Hell yeah (It was of my own packet functions breaking it :facepalm:)
