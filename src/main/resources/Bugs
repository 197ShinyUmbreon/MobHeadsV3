    "-" Not Fixed.
    "-X-" Fixed.

-X-Chested Heads would disallow gliding regardless of containers held
-Slime/Magma Cube heads will occasionally store a jump that will unleash on teleport/camera move/reapplication of head after death.
-X-Head or Decollation Pearl is voided when inventory is full
-X-Guardians do not restore Air on Frog Head
-X-Breaking an Armor Stand will attempt to drop a head
-X-Right-Clicking with an empty hand on someone wearing a Mooshroom Head does not give food
-X-Head worn Tab list does not update on death.
-X-New Player skins are not updated with a new head (if PlayerProfile != old.PlayerProfile, replace?)
-X-Warden Head allows you to run with Darkness now??? Hell yeah (It was of my own packet functions breaking it :facepalm:)
